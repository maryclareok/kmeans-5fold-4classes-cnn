The model is trained using k-fold cross-validation, a procedure where the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal sized subsamples. Of the k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining k-1 subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated k times, with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The k results can then be averaged to produce a single estimation.

The second part of the code is about evaluating the performance of the trained model. It imports necessary modules for creating plots and calculating metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, ROC curve, and AUC. These metrics provide various ways to measure the performance of the model on the classification task.
